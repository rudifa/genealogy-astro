### 4. Graph Visualization

**DOT Graph Generation**

## 🎯 User Experience

### Adding/Editing Info

1. Click "Add Person" or click on existing person
2. Fill in the "Info" field with relevant details
3. Info appears as placeholder text: "e.g., Birth year, profession, location..."
4. Maximum 200 characters allowed
5. Real-time validation provides feedback

### Graph Display

- **Single line**: Shows just the person's name (when no info)
- **Two lines**: Shows name on first line, info on second line
- **Formatting**: Clean, readable display in graph boxes
- **Clickable**: Both lines are clickable to edit the person

## 📋 Field Usage Examples

The info field can contain various types of information:

- **Birth/Death dates**: "1920-1995", "Born 1970"
- **Life events**: "Married 1945", "Moved to London 1960"
- **Professions**: "Teacher", "Doctor", "Artist"
- **Locations**: "Lives in Paris", "Born in Dublin"
- **Notes**: "Emigrated from Ireland", "War veteran"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Storage

```json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "mother": "Mary Smith",
  "father": "Robert Smith",
  "info": "1945-2020, Engineer"
}
```

### Graph Rendering

```dot
"John Smith" [label="John Smith\\n1945-2020, Engineer"];
```

### Form Validation

- **Optional field**: No validation errors if left empty
- **Length limit**: Maximum 200 characters
- **Real-time feedback**: Updates as user types
- **Trimmed storage**: Leading/trailing whitespace removed

## 🚀 Benefits

### Enhanced Genealogy Records

### Improved User Experience

- **Intuitive editing**: Natural extension of existing person editing

### Maintainable Implementation

- **Backward compatible**: Existing data without info continues to work

## 📝 Testing Verified

- ✅ **Add new person** with info → Info displays in graph
- ✅ **Edit existing person** info → Graph updates immediately

- ✅ **Language switching** → Info field label translates correctly
- ✅ **Tree operations** → Info preserved during tree switches
- ✅ **Data persistence** → Info saved to localStorage correctly

### Test Coverage Added

Added comprehensive test suite in `test/GenealogyData.test.js`:

#### Person Info Field Tests (10 tests)

- Info field initialization and auto-generation
- Adding persons with and without info
- Info field updates and clearing
- DOT string generation with two-line labels
- Quote escaping and whitespace handling

## 🎉 Conclusion

The person info field feature successfully extends the genealogy application with richer biographical data while maintaining the clean, modular architecture. The implementation provides an intuitive way for users to add and view additional family member information directly in the visual graph display.
