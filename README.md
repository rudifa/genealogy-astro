## Implementation Details

- The revised implementation uses a global appState object (based on a State module).
- appState provides subscribe/notify event handling.
- appState exposes action functions for Astro component scripts to update the data model.
- Components subscribe to state changes, call actions, and access data via appState.

This pattern is commonly known as the Observer pattern (for the subscribe/notify mechanism) combined with a centralized state management approach. In frontend development, this is often referred to as a "state container" or "store" pattern. Popular libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Vuex use similar concepts.

In summary, the revised implementation uses a global state container with observer/event subscription, sometimes called a "reactive store" or "observable state management."

This implementation is conceptually similar to how SwiftUI manages state and UI updates, though there are differences in language and framework specifics:

- Both use a centralized state management approach:
  - In this app, appState acts as a global store with subscribe/notify (observer pattern).
  - In SwiftUI, @State, @ObservedObject, and @EnvironmentObject provide reactive state containers.

- Both enable components (views) to subscribe to state changes and automatically update when the state changes.

- Both encourage unidirectional data flow:
  - Actions/methods update the state, which then notifies subscribers (components/views) to re-render.

Key differences:

- SwiftUIâ€™s reactivity and view updates are built into the language and framework, with property wrappers and automatic view invalidation.
- This implementation is manual, using JavaScript/TypeScript and custom observer logic.
